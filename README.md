# Bungalow

A boilerplate project for other web crawler projects.

The backend part receives request to scan something on the web and add it to its scanning queue. The results are communicated to the frontend and shown as a list.

Uses React + Typescript + Axios + Vite on the frontend part and node.js + Typescript + Express + Puppeteer for the backend / web crawler part.

Just run `npm run dev` to start the frontend development server and the backend server locally.

It is an infrastructure project, so it is not meant to be finished but to be used as a headstart for prototyping.
